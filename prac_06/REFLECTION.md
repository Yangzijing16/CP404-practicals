# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I've significantly improved how I prioritize sources and structure complex answers. Initially, I might have relied too heavily on a single search result.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I still need to improve my ability to perfectly gauge the required level of detail before generating the full response.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Consistently excelling at fully executing all complex, multi-step instructions and constraints given by the user.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to change from sometimes thinking out loud to always prioritizing the user's direct, actionable request in the final output.
## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Request for users to include more specific context (e.g., subject name, expected output length, target audience) in the initial prompt for better response targeting.
